  "love_giving_heading": "Love is primarily about giving, not taking:",

  "love_art_heading": "Love is an art that you can master through theory and practice:",

  "self_love_point2": "Selfishness and self-love are mutually opposite.",
  "self_love_point3": "The egoist is basically incapable of loving either others or himself, since he judges everyone and everything only by the benefit he can derive.",
  "god_love_heading": "Love for God is not a thought about it and not a mental knowledge of God, but living in unity with him:",
  "god_love_point1": "A truly believing person does not ask for anything and does not expect anything from God for himself; he has enough humility to realize his limitations, to understand that he knows nothing about God.",
  "god_love_point2": "He finds the value of his life in how fully it allows his human potential to unfold as the only reality that has true meaning for him.",
