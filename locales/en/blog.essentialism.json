  "main_description": "Every day, dozens of tasks, ideas, and proposals fall upon each of us. A non-Essentialist is ready to chase after the first opportunity that comes along, agreeing to everything possible; an Essentialist, on the other hand, adheres to the principle of doing less but better. They are very selective in what to focus on, exclude everything secondary, and know how to say 'no' decisively yet gracefully.",

  "zuckerberg_quote": "I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community.

  "takeaway_heading": "What I took away from this book",
  "takeaway_text1": "The book helped me significantly improve my decision-making process.",
  "takeaway_text2": "I believe that the ability to distinguish truly important things from noise is one of the key skills of our time. For this, it's absolutely necessary to have clear goals that inspire. Moreover, having a clear purpose eliminates thousands of other questions.",
  "takeaway_text3": "The process of determining the importance of each action/idea/purchase is quite interesting (at least for me...), as I believe it leads to self-knowledge, better understanding of oneself. This, in turn, leads to a greater sense of inner happiness and peace.",
  "takeaway_text4": "It's important to learn to say 'no' â€” accept only those tasks for which you really have time and resources. This allows you to perform work with higher quality, experience less stress, and stay more focused. Do the work where you can make the greatest contribution;",
  "takeaway_text5": "We live in a world of endless information and entertainment flow. It's important to set aside free time to hear your inner voice about what truly matters to you. Outside noise drowns it out. For better understanding, I additionally recommend watching Andrei Kurpatov's speech at the business breakfast in Davos.",
  "takeaway_text6": "The book wrote about the importance of sleep, and I 'leveled up' in this area. Sleep is one of the key factors in improving productivity.",
  "takeaway_text7": "On one hand, essentialism simplified my decision-making process. On the other hand, it can be quite complex and tiring, requiring dedication and practice. When you really try to apply the principles of essentialism, you often find yourself acting in opposition to the people around you. You say no when others say yes, reflect when others act, listen when others speak.",
  "takeaway_text8": "But it's worth it! I listened to the audiobook in one breath ðŸ™‚"
