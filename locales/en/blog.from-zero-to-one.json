  "takeaway_text2": "After creating a testing course a couple of years ago, I decided to take a step forward - launch a school using the innovative ISA (Income Share Agreement) model. In this case, the student pays for education as a percentage of their income and only after successful employment. Looking ahead, I'll say that the business didn't work out, but that's a completely different story. The point is that the book helped me come to this. And the experience itself is worth a lot, I learned a huge number of lessons.",
  "takeaway_text3": "Overall, the book is inspiring and interesting, just like its author. About the author, I want to add that there aren't many successful entrepreneurs, even fewer serial-successful ones, and Peter Thiel not only became one himself but created an entire mafia in the business world around him - the 'PayPal Mafia.' For which he deserves great respect, as it's hard to imagine our reality without the companies these people stand behind."
